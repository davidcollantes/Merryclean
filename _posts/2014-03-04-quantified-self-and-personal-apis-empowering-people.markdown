A year ago, I red a great article on Naveen Selvadurai’s blog where it confessed his interest for Quantified Self.

In his post, Naveen wrote that as a student he already made that experiment. He basically tracked his daily book consumption on a Excel file, like a athlete would do with his workout log. He even released a JSON sample of personal datas, some very intimate such as sleep hours.

This sample was, in a way, what we could call a personal API.

### Is Quantified Self Really An Empowerment ?

Quantified Self has been quite a big hit this year, we saw a new market emerging with a lot of connected objects for tracking pretty much everything.

Quantified Self is supposed to improve people. Sadly, Fuelband, Fitbit and such are basically objects that allows people to track, archive datas automatically and make it understandable. But, in the end, the user stays in a “problem” zone : ok I know I ran 7 miles in 45 minutes and burned 850 calories, but what how do I improve ?

So is QS really improving my life ?

The product itself (connected object, sensor, or whatever) does not bring any solution, it is just a way to collect datas, a recipient. The true intelligence of QS, the real empowerment comes with the API you build upon it. Once you get datas, your job as a QS start-up is to bring a concrete solution to a concrete individual problem using those datas and algorithms.

### Personal Datas & APIs ?

Now picture a way to collect very intimate datas such as mood, sleep hours, menstrual cycle, etc. (true personal datas) and generate an API with those datas. I am not discussing the risks of releasing such API, but the (sad) truth is that in a society where “productivity” and “perpetual improvement” are key, people are actually seeking for ways to improve themselves. So, there is a place for life-improving-algorithms.

Another problem is who will collect those datas ? Personally, I don’t feel confortable with a brand collecting “intimate” datas, maybe it is time for the user to collect its own datas. Maybe, it is our job to provide a simple tool to do so without keeping any of those datas in our servers.

We could also provide a way for those individuals to release parts of their own API. For example your doctor could just send a GET request to your personal API to read in real-time parameters such as sleeping datas, heart rate, calories burned, etc.

I would not be surprised if we get there in a very short period of time.
